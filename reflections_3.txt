When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when you are collaborating with multiple programmers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-if you are working on something that you havent commited yet, you wouldnt want it to pull and replace all of your un commited work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-clone means you have a local copy of another repository, branch is when you have a seperate time line of commits in the same repository and a fork is when you have an online copy of another github repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-You can know all of the work you have done without syncing with the online repository in any way, by comparing the origin/master repository with your master brnach 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

-email or dropbox or google drive or something. It would be easier to use because you wouldnt have to learn command line but it would be much much much less useful.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

-when you make an experimental change or want to make a change that will need the go ahead when collaborating on a project. This is to always have a fully functioning master branch
