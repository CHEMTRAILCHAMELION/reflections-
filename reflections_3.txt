When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when you are collaborating with multiple programmers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-if you are working on something that you havent commited yet, you wouldnt want it to pull and replace all of your un commited work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-clone means you have a local copy of another repository, branch is when you have a seperate time line of commits in the same repository and a fork is when you have an online copy of another github repository.
