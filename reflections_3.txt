When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when you are collaborating with multiple programmers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-if you are working on something that you havent commited yet, you wouldnt want it to pull and replace all of your un commited work.
